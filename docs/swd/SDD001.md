# Design Elements

The simple package provides a convenient example and baseline project
structure for demonstrating current packaging standards with dynamic
versioning using the core setuptools package and default PEP517 build
backend.

The primary install dependencies are importlib-metadata, doorstop, and
munch, where doorstop is primarily an offline dependency for managing
requirements data. Complete package dependencies are shown in the
figure below:
