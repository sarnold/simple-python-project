  Requirements overview

  The simple package is intended to provide a simple but modern example of
  creating a project/package using setuptools/setuptools-scm with the latest
  metadata and default build backend for PEP517 compliance.

  The main dependencies are shown below.

  - [importlib-metadata](https://pypi.org/project/importlib-metadata/)
    - used for runtime version retrieval (for older Python)
  - [munch](https://github.com/Infinidat/munch)
    - an example convenience library for adding attribute access to dictionaries

  The simple package should demonstrate the following items.

  - project metadata and tool configuration in pyproject.toml
  - project docs with auto-generated requirements, SW design, and API/interfaces
  - getting-started setup doc and github/tox workflow automation
  - working pre-commit configuration and REUSE license compliance

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > The above item `short_name` is a custom doorstop attribute and
  > must be added to the doorstop config file, as well as populated
  > with the desired "alias" for the given item.
