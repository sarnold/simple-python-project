# 1.0 Requirements overview {#REQ001}

Requirements overview

The simple package is intended to provide a simple but modern example of
creating a project/package using setuptools/setuptools-scm with the latest
metadata and default build backend for PEP517 compliance.

The main dependencies are shown below.

- [importlib-metadata](https://pypi.org/project/importlib-metadata/)
  - used for runtime version retrieval (for older Python)
- [munch](https://github.com/Infinidat/munch)
  - an example convenience library for adding attribute access to dictionaries

The simple package should demonstrate the following items.

- project metadata and tool configuration in pyproject.toml
- project docs with auto-generated requirements, SW design, and API/interfaces
- getting-started setup doc and github/tox workflow automation
- working pre-commit configuration and REUSE license compliance

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The above item `short_name` is a custom doorstop attribute and
> must be added to the doorstop config file, as well as populated
> with the desired "alias" for the given item.
