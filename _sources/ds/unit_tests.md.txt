Automated Tests

Whether desktop or CI, run these tests from the project root,
after installing Python and [Tox](https://github.com/tox-dev/tox):

```shell
tox -e py
```

To see test output, ie, code under test and print statements, append
the following positional arg to the above tox command:

```shell
tox -e py -- no
```
